This week I worked on actually using Google's Natural Language Processing API
to the sentiment of tweets. I had to create an account and then 
send the text of the tweets and a score was returned. Next week I'm going
to work on actually do analysis with that data. The biggest issue this week
is that it costs money to actually use Google's API so we were only to do a limited
number of tweets, and there really isn't anyway around that other than finding
some other form of sentiment analysis that works.
