This week I looked into doing analysis using the scores that we got 
from the Google API. The general idea is to group the tweets by the 
day that they were tweeted and find the average sentiment for that day.
Beyond that, I tried a bunch of different variations of that, including
only looking at tweets that had a certain number of likes or looking a different
alignment of days and so on. We were able to find some pretty promising results. 
Next week I will work on devolping a more stock centric sentiment analysis tool.
The big issue is that we do not have sentiment scores for that many tweets due to 
the finacial limitations of Google's API.
