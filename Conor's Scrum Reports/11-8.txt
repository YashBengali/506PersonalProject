This week I looked into different types of sentiment analysis. Yash is looking
into just using the NLTK package. I'm thinking of using Google's Natural
Language Processing API because I have used it in the past, or doing a more
stock centric way of doing it.  Next week I'm going to work on actually implementing 
the different types of sentiment analysis. Last week I was focusing on getting Etherium
tweets but I just don't think I'm going to have enough meaningful data 
to reach any real conclusions, so unless I can find a dataset that already exists our
project will be Apple only.
