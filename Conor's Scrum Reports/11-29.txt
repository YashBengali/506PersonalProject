This week I worked on building a sentiment analysis tool based
on stocks. I found a kaggle dataset that contains stock 
tweets that are labelled as positive or negative. Based on that I 
created a model that determines if a tweet fits that definition of 
positive or negative. Then I fed new tweets into that model to get scores.
Then I did the same type of analysis that I did last week using the 
Google API scores. Next week I will work on the final project. 
The biggest issue is that the dataset that I used
to create the model is not very big and does not have clear guidelines
to what a tweet being positive entails, there are also some tweets
that are not clearly positive or clearly negative so it is unclear what 
the policy in dealing with those tweets are.
