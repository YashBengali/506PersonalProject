I worked on scrapping tweets about companies other than Apple. I speciffically looked at Etherium becuase
I think it would be interesting to see if what we learn about the stock market applies to something
newer like cryptocurrency which has been studied a lot less. Since Twitter has buffed their anti-scrapping 
policies, really the only way to do it is through their api and using a thrid party tool like tweepy.
I was able to gather quite a few tweets, although a lot of them are retweets, so in the future I 
will trim down the data so everything is more useful. I will also continue scrapping and maybe look into
how to do sentiment analysis. The biggest issue is lack of available tweets, it would be helpful if there 
was already a dataset that contained all of the Etherium tweets, but that doesn't seem to exist.
