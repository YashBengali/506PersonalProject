What have I worked on?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worked on project report and final presentation.

What will I be working on next?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thats a wrap! Nothing to work on past this point, except possible last minute changes we notice along the way.

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No issues this week.

Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not applicable. We worked on a personal project, so we did not have to meet with a client.
